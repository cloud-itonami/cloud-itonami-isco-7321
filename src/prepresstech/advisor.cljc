  "Pre-press Technician Advisor — proposing a pre-press workshop
  scheduling/logistics coordination operation (log a work record,
  schedule a crew operation, flag a safety concern, coordinate a
  plate/imaging-materials supply order) from a crew roster, workshop
  registration and safety-reporting policy. Swappable mock/llm; the
  advisor ONLY proposes — `prepresstech.governor` independently gates
  every proposal and always escalates safety concerns and
  above-threshold supply orders. The advisor never proposes to
  directly finalize a plate-preparation-execution decision (e.g. a
  specific plate-preparation or plate-processing procedure) or to
  override a shop safety officer's judgment — those stay permanently
  out of this actor's scope. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-7311's
  advisor for the physical-safety-domain shape.

   :cost/:hazard-type/:task fields, an honest :confidence and a
