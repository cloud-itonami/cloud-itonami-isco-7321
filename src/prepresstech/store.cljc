  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 7321 pre-press workshop scheduling/logistics
  coordination actor (itonami actor pattern, ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md
  Actors section; README's 'Robotics premise' — a workshop
  scheduling/logistics coordination robot performs crew scheduling,
  task/materials-usage/progress-record logging and
  plate/imaging-materials supply-order coordination for a pre-press
  shop crew under this advisor/governor pair, which never dispatches
  hardware itself, never performs plate-preparation or
  plate-processing work itself, and never finalizes a
  plate-preparation-execution decision or overrides a shop safety
  officer's judgment — those remain the shop safety officer's
  exclusive judgment). Modeled on
  cloud-itonami-isco-7311's instrumentmaker.store for the
  physical-safety-domain shape.

  Domain:

    worker   — a registered pre-press shop crew member (:worker-id,
               :name)
    workshop — a registered pre-press shop {:workshop-id :name
               :max-supply-cost}. `:max-supply-cost` is an
               informational registered ceiling used only to decide
               whether a `:coordinate-supply-order` proposal escalates
               to human sign-off (the governor never blocks a
               within-threshold order outright; it only decides
               commit vs. escalate).
    record   — a committed operating record (a logged
               job/materials-usage/progress entry, a scheduled crew
               operation, a flagged safety concern, or a coordinated
               supply order) — written ONLY via commit-record!.
    ledger   — append-only audit trail, commit or hold.")
